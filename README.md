# AI_Chatbot
💬 Artificial Intelligence Chatbot (Java)
It is a Java-based Artificial Intelligence Chatbot that interacts with users through a graphical user interface (GUI) and responds to common queries using basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) and rule-based logic.

📌 Features
🧠 Java-based chatbot for interactive communication
💻 Swing GUI for user-friendly interaction
🗣️ Basic NLP to understand and interpret user inputs
🤖 Rule-based logic to generate appropriate responses
📚 Pre-trained on common FAQs to simulate intelligent behavior
🌐 Real-time interaction via GUI interface

🔧 Technologies Used
1.Java

2.Java Swing (for GUI)

3.Simple NLP logic (String matching and keyword recognition)

4.Rule-based response system

🛠️ How It Works
1.The user types a message in the input field.
2.The chatbot analyzes the message using simple NLP techniques (e.g., keyword detection).
3.A relevant response is generated from a pre-defined list of possible replies.
4.The conversation continues in a human-like flow via the GUI.

🧪 Future Improvements
1.Integrate advanced NLP libraries like OpenNLP or Stanford NLP.
2.Add learning capabilities using machine learning techniques.
3.Connect to external APIs like Dialogflow or GPT models for smarter replies.
4.Deploy as a web-based chatbot using Java web technologies.
